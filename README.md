# HUDL-Emulator ðŸ¤¯ DOOM MODE ðŸ¤¯
An emulator for the EVT-HUDL device. Very rudimentary and does not actually emulate the full device. Just enough functionality for the emulator to display data.

## What is ðŸ¤¯ DOOM MODE ðŸ¤¯???
ðŸ¤¯ DOOM MODE ðŸ¤¯ is a port of DOOM 1 (1993) to the HUDL display. This source port uses the [doomgeneric](https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric) port for its internal game. The majority of work for porting is found in main.cpp, and consists of getting the game actually displaying on the HUDL.

### To get ðŸ¤¯ DOOM MODE ðŸ¤¯ running
To get ðŸ¤¯ DOOM MODE ðŸ¤¯ running, you will need to add `-iwad ./doom/DOOM1.wad` as your program arguments. This tells the core doom game where the WAD file is that it should play off of. You will need to supply your own WAD file to get the emulator up and running.

#### Changes to Doomgeneric
Some changes are needed to Doomgeneric to allow it to interoperate with C++. The changes are all in one file, for ease this file has been provided below, just replace `doom/doomgeneric/doomgeneric/doomgeneric.h` (that's a lot of doomgeneric) with this file.
```c
#ifndef DOOM_GENERIC
#define DOOM_GENERIC

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#define DOOMGENERIC_RESX 320
#define DOOMGENERIC_RESY 200

extern uint32_t* DG_ScreenBuffer;

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
    void DG_Init();
    void DG_DrawFrame();
    void DG_SleepMs(uint32_t ms);
    uint32_t DG_GetTicksMs();
    int DG_GetKey(int* pressed, unsigned char* key);
    void DG_SetWindowTitle(const char * title);
};
#else
void DG_Init();
void DG_DrawFrame();
void DG_SleepMs(uint32_t ms);
uint32_t DG_GetTicksMs();
int DG_GetKey(int* pressed, unsigned char* key);
void DG_SetWindowTitle(const char * title);
#endif
#endif //DOOM_GENERIC
```

## Install Dependencies
To install and run the emulator, you need a few libraries.
